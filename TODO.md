# TO DO

## Next

-   [ ] Remove unecessary `_meta` props.
-   [ ] Make sure `resolveBundles()` works like it does in `test.js`.

## Committed

-   [ ] Create sourcemaps bundler with something like [concat-with-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concat-with-sourcemaps) to generate sourcemaps from the beginning.

## Maybe Someday

-   [ ] Allow input to come from `stdin`.
-   [ ] Add `on.rename` hook? Or use `on.includeFiles` hook above?
-   [ ] Add `cwd` option.
-   [ ] Move `file.source.path` to `file.from`.
